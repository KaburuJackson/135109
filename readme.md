Over the past decade social media usage has grown exponentially in Kenya. Between the year 2004 and 2022 the number of Kenyans on social media grew from 3.8 million to 11.8 million. This has led to most companies shifting their marketing and messaging focus to online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and more recently, TikTok. Twitter remains the only major text media centred platform as others lean heavily on image and video forms of media. Through leveraging on text media Twitter has positioned itself as the go-to platform for free speech.
This has led to Twitter’s growth in popularity among the Kenyan population where users can freely share their thoughts and opinions. Kenyans on Twitter have earned themselves an eminent reputation of being one of the most vibrant communities on the platform. This creates an opportunity for government institutions to leverage on sentiment analysis technology to investigate the citizens’ opinion on various government operations and policies This study proposes opinion mining through sentiment analysis on Twitter data by government institutions as a faster way of public participation in policy making, public relation activities and crises management.
